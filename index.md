## Vnote

Vnote is an alternative and experimental musical notation. It is based on the following principles:

1. **Treat all twelve notes as equal citizens**: Vnote uses a single number to represent each of the twelve notes of the [octave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament). There is no concept of sharps or flats.
2. **Use the graphical possibilities of the digital age**: the widespread availability of computers allows faithful reproduction of alternate graphical arrangements to express music. Vnote uses colors to represent octaves and line widths to express note durations.
3. **Share music through an open format based in JSON**: Vnote stores music in an open source format based on JSON, which is easy to parse and to edit.
4. **Stimulate the exploration of approaches to express music**: the standard musical notation is a refined, time-tested and indisputable tool for writing music. This project considers, however, that the time is ripe to explore alternatives and improvements to it. Vnote is a contribution to this latent potential.
